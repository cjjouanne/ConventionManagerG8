# Convetion Maganer
> By Group 8

This app was built for the Detailed Software Design class (**IIC2113**). It's a convention manager, where you can organize big events, and get feedback from those who attended the event. You can create different types of events inside your convetion la lectures, parties, etc. Also, you can set the location, add maps, invite friends, subscribe to events, and more!

## Does it works?

Yes, it works. It doesn't do much, but it works just fine.
